As a hotel maintenance user, 

I want to manage contact information for a hotel 

so that I can maintain accurate phone numbers, fax numbers, manager information, and communication details for distribution systems.

The Contact section is part of the General tab in the Hotel Maintenance application and manages all contact-related information for hotels. This section handles phone numbers, fax numbers, manager details, and other communication information organized into logical groupings.
