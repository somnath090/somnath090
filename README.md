Description

As a developer, when a new property is created in the RSS system, 

I want to ensure that the MLOS strategy defaults to ‘S’ (stay Through) so that the booking process is streamlined and consistency is maintained across all properties.

Context

The hotel legal processor service needs a change. This change will ensure that the MLOS strategy is set to ‘S’ (stay Through) by default when a property is created in the RSS system.

Acceptance Criteria

MLOS strategy must default to ‘S’ (stay Through) when a new property is created in the RSS system.

The change should ensure consistency across all properties.
