As a developer,

 I want to create default amenities for the new Brand - SSAW in the HDS database

 so that users can have a standardized set of amenities available for selection in Propel.

Context:

Default amenities will need to be added to AMENITY_TAG table in HDS DB.

Acceptance Criteria

The system should allow the creation of default amenities that can be easily displayed for users in Propel.
